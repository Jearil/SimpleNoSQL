/**
 * <p>The main way of interacting with your data is via a QueryBuilder. The QueryBuilder can be used for both storage and
 * retrieval. You may also delete using the QueryBuilder. Additional parameters can be added using the various 'with'
 * or 'add' methods. Some methods only apply to one class of operation, which will be noted in the documentation of
 * each method.
 * <p>
 * A sample of a save operation:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     NoSQLEntity<String> entity = new NoSQLEntity<String>("bucket1", "string1");
 *     entity.setData("Some data to store");
 *     QueryBuilder<String> builder = new QueryBuilder<String>(context, String.class)
 *       .save(entity);
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>A sample of a retrieval operation for that data:
 * <pre>
 *     QueryBuilder<String> builder = new QueryBuilder<String>(context, String.class)
 *       .bucketId("bucket1")
 *       .entityId("string1")
 *       .retrieve(new RetrievalCallback<String>() {
 *           public void retrievedResults(List<NoSQLEntity<String>> entities) {
 *              // display String to screen
 *              textView.setText(entities.get(0).getData());
 *           }
 *       });
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>A sample deletion of that same data:
 * <pre>
 *     QueryBuilder<String> builder = new QueryBuilder<String>(context, String.class)
 *       .bucketId("bucket1")
 *       .entityId("string1")
 *       .delete();
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Save operations can have a single RetrievalCallback which runs on the UI thread. Any operation (including saving) can
 * have any number of {@link com.colintmiller.simplenosql.OperationObserver}'s that can be notified when the operation
 * is complete.
